Ingredients for 2 person:

- 150gr Spaghetti nÂ°5
- 1 clove of Garlic
- 1 (or 2) fresh hot pepper
- 40gr extra virgin olive oil
- 40gr grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese

Bring to the boil of water in a saucepan and salt to taste. 
Start cooking the pasta and in the meantime prepare the sauce.
For the sauce, peel the garlic clove and brown it with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil together with the chilli pepper. 
Garlic must only brown, not burn. 
If the oil is too hot, remove the pot from the heat and let it rest.
When the pasta is cooked al dente drain (preserved the cooking water) 
and add it to the sauce pan leaving a little of the cooking liquid.
Finish cooking the pasta together with the sauce, 
adding from time to time a little cooking water previously stored, 
until you reach the optimal cooking.
Serve and sprinkle with plenty of grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.

Enjoy your meal.
